# Glectron Example Application
This is an example to build a Glectron application at the moment, can be used as a starter template.

Please note that current application development workflow is incomplete, and Glectron is still unstable. It's not a good idea to build a Glectron application now.

Also, this example application is only designed to be compatible with Chromium, which means it won't work properly in Awesomium-based Garry's Mod.
